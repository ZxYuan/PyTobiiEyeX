# PyTobiiEyeX
Since Tobii does not supply an official Python SDK for Tobii EyeX Controller, this repo offers a Python demo for tracking eyemovement data using Tobii EyeX Controller, especially used for recording eye data during psycho visual experiment, by using ctypes module and DLL library.

This repo also offers a DLL library ( Both 32 bit and 64 bit),  MinimalGazeDataStream.dll, made by modifying the official gaze data stream sample from Tobii. Please refer to the official sdk if you would like to see how it works internally. http://developer.tobii.com/
